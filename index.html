            <p>I know words can't undo what happened, but I need you to know how deeply sorry I am.</p>
            
            <p>I let myself be influenced by others and allowed insecurity to cloud my judgment. I accused you of something you never did, and I broke your trust. That was completely wrong of me.</p>
            
            <p>You were loyal, honest, and gave me your heart despite the distance between us. Instead of trusting you, I doubted you. I realize now how much I hurt you, and I take full responsibility for my actions.</p>
            
            <p>I know nobody is perfect and we all make mistakes. But that doesn't make what I did okay. I'm learning from this and I hope you can see that I genuinely didn't mean to hurt you.</p>
            
            <p>I'm not asking you to forgive me right away, or even to take me back. I just want you to know that I see my mistake clearly now, and I'm genuinely sorry for the pain I caused you.</p>
            
            <p>Whatever you decide, I respect your feelings and your decision. You deserve happiness and someone who trusts you completely.</p>
